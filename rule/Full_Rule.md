# Full Rule

Firstly, this is a tabletop game with a mathematical background. The goal is to obtain more victory points（VP） under limited game conditions.

## Victory conditions
- When either side surrenders at any time, the other side wins
- When the game ends, calculate the victory points. The specific calculation method is explained in the "End of Game Scoring" section. Victory points can be negative. The player with more victory points wins. 
- If the VP are tied, the player with the most psuedo-victory points (PVP) wins.
- If the VP and PVP are tied, it is a draw.

## Conditions for 'End of Game Scoring'
- When either player enters the end phase of their turn, and there are no cards left in the deck before the start of their opponent's turn, the game ends, and end of game scoring begins.
- The game ends instantly when either player reaches 10 or more PVPs, and end of game scoring begins.
- When either player enters the end phase of their turn and all public lanes in the game are occupied, the game ends, and end of game scoring begins. 

## Gameplay process.

### Preparation before the game begins

Both players should check each other's decks before the game begins.
- Each deck must consist of at least 40 cards and not exceed 60 cards
- The total number of victory points on assertion cards must not 
exceed the number of cards in the player's deck.

Afterwards, both parties `flip a coin` to determine who goes first. Each person starts with 5 `initial hand cards`.
- The first player draws one less card during their "draw phase" in the first turn.
The game begins, and each player takes turns to play their respective rounds. The game will end when the termination conditions are met, and a 'End of Game Scoring' will take place.

### phases in turn
Each player's turn consists of the following phases:
- turn start phase
- standby phase
- draw phase
- action pahse
- end pahse

#### Turn start phase
turn start phase. Some card effects are triggered during this phase. Turn start phase cannot be skipped. After the turn start phase, standby phase is executed.

#### Standby phase
Standby phase.Some card effects are triggered during this phase.After the  Standby phase ,draw phase is executed.

#### Draw phase
- draw phase,Some card effects are triggered during this phase.After the draw phase ,action pahse is executed.
- Except for the first turn of the player who goes first, each player can draw two cards from the remaining deck during their draw phase. (The player who goes first in their first turn can only draw one card.)
- When there is only one card left in the deck, draw a card from the top of the discard pile to ensure that two cards are added to the hand.

#### Action pahse
Action phase is the main phase of the game. Cards in the game can be used. They have the following types:
- Value Card
- Operator Card
- Assertion Card
- Function Card
- Legend Card

The usage of each type of card is relatively complicated and will be introduced in the later rules

#### End pahse
- End pahse,Some card effects are triggered during this phase.
- Before the end of the end phase, it is necessary to check the number of cards in the current player's hand. If it is greater than 7, the excess cards need to be discarded to the discard pile, and the player needs to deduct the pseudo victory point equal to the number of discarded cards from their total points (if there are any).
- After the end phase, it is the opponent's turn to start a new turn.

## Game Field
The game field consists of lanes (public/private), value area, operator area, assertion area (public/private), and legend area as shown in the following figure:
