# TCG Math Magic Card Desgin
[中文](/README_CN.md)

I have invented a tabletop game that I think is cool, but my resources and abilities are limited. I hope to develop and grow it through the community. If you are interested, please read and join in.[Join Discard](https://discord.gg/dfTFBYvS)

- Q: What is TGC?
  - A: TCG stands for Trading Card Game, which refers to a type of game where players use their own card combinations to compete against other players. Each card represents different characters, abilities, or equipment, and can be obtained by purchasing card packs or trading with other players to enrich their card collections and improve their strength in the game. Well-known TCG games include Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, Yu-Gi-Oh!, etc.
- Q: What kind of game is Math Magic Card?
  - A: Math Magic Card is a game dedicated to integrating pure mathematical concepts into tabletop games. Of course, there will be magical elements, but I guarantee that the core winning mechanism is based on mathematical concepts.
- Q: Why design such a game?
  - A: Just For Fun!

# Simple Rules
Please note that Simple Rules are designed to help you understand the core concepts of this game. Once you have a good understanding of the Simple Rules, I recommend reading the detailed rules for more strategic choices.

Before we begin, please allow me to introduce the three basic card types in this game. They are Value cards, Operator cards, and Assertion cards.

## Value cards
Value cards represent the purest form of value, such as the number 1 or the number 2. Their meaning is similar to what you would understand as mathematical 1 and 2 in everyday life, just expressed in the form of cards.          
## Operator cards
The concept of an Operator may not be common in your daily life, but you certainly know the symbol `+`. It is generally called the addition symbol. The operator cards we are referring to here are similar to technical symbols that you commonly encounter, such as `+` and `-`. As you may have noticed, operator cards represent symbols that can link two 'values' (corresponding to value cards in the game) together to form a new expression, such as `1+1`, `4-3`, and so on.
## Assertion cards
An Assertion card contains a statement describing a mathematical concept, such as "this is an even number" or "this is an odd number". We can obtain a value through an expression formed by Value cards and Operator cards, and then use our mathematical knowledge to determine the truth or falsehood of the assertion. For example, `1+1 | is odd` and `1+1 | is even`. We know that the first combination is false and the second combination is true.

The assertion card states that in addition to the assertion itself, there are two very important things on the card: victory points(VP) and failure points(FP). What are these values used for? They are used to determine which side wins or loses the game in the end. For each true combination, your final victory points will be increased by the victory points on that assertion card. Conversely, if it is false, points will be deducted. The person with the most victory points at the end wins, or it's a tie.


## Play The Game
With these concepts in mind, you can create your own deck and battle with friends. If you don't have extra cards, it's also possible for two people to share a deck. Each player starts with five cards in their hand. Then flip a coin to decide who goes first. Draw two new cards each turn, play cards, and if you have more than seven cards in your hand, discard some. Then it's your opponent's turn to draw cards, play cards, and discard. Repeat this process, which is similar to many games you may have played before. The important thing is playing cards, which is called the "action phase" in the full rules. Let's see what you can do during the action phase in the simplified rules.

Now imagine there are some spaces between you and your opponent. There are a total of five, which is just enough to place five cards. Odd-numbered places are for value cards, and even-numbered ones are for operator cards. Let's name these five spaces "lanes". The odd-numbered lane is called the "value area", and the even-numbered lane is called the "operator area". Then find a nearby location and name it the "assertion area." You may have already guessed that this is where assertion cards are specifically placed. The difference is that only one card can be placed on the value and operator areas, while many cards can be placed on the assertion area. You and your opponent each have an assertion area.

What can you do when playing a card? You can place a value card or an operator card in the lanes. Just make sure to place them in the corresponding area. (In the full rules, there are restrictions on how to place cards, but you can ignore them in the simplified rules.) However, you can only choose one action to perform.

In addition, you can also place an assertion card in your own assertion area. That's right! These are the only actions you can take.

## Determining the end and victory/defeat.
So how do you determine when the game ends and who wins? At the end of each turn, you need to check whether all five areas in the lanes are filled with cards. If the lanes are full, the game ends, and it's time to determine the winner.

As mentioned above, you need to calculate the value formed by the values and operators in the lanes. Then each player uses this value and combines it with each assertion card in their own assertion area. If an assertion is true, victory points are added (VP), and if an assertion is false, victory points are subtracted (FP). Then compare which player has more victory points, and the player with more points wins.

It sounds simple, doesn't it? In the game, you need to predict possible values in the lanes and plan your assertion strategy carefully. Setting too many assertions may actually lead to failure.

I don't need anything particularly complex. I just need your enthusiasm and participation. You can:
- Help design a logo, there is currently no good-looking logo.
- Help design card illustrations or artwork.
- Help design cards. I know there are still many, many cards needed.
- Help optimize the rules. I have optimized some of the rules myself, but I know they are not enough.
- Help test the cards that have already been released.
- Help with translation. I hope there will also be a Japanese version!
- Help with promotion.
- Just play it and give feedback on your experience.
