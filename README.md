[中文](/README_CN.md)

I have invented a tabletop game that I think is cool, but my resources and abilities are limited. I hope to develop and grow it through the community. If you are interested, please read and join in.[Join Discard](https://discord.gg/dfTFBYvS)

- Q: What is TGC?
  - A: TCG stands for Trading Card Game, which refers to a type of game where players use their own card combinations to compete against other players. Each card represents different characters, abilities, or equipment, and can be obtained by purchasing card packs or trading with other players to enrich their card collections and improve their strength in the game. Well-known TCG games include Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, Yu-Gi-Oh!, etc.
- Q: What kind of game is Math Magic Card?
  - A: Math Magic Card is a game dedicated to integrating pure mathematical concepts into tabletop games. Of course, there will be magical elements, but I guarantee that the core winning mechanism is based on mathematical concepts.
- Q: Why design such a game?
  - A: Just For Fun!

# Simple Rules
Please note that Simple Rules are designed to help you understand the core concepts of this game. Once you have a good understanding of the Simple Rules, I recommend reading the detailed rules for more strategic choices.

Before we begin, please allow me to introduce the three basic card types in this game. They are Value cards, Operator cards, and Assertion cards.

## Value cards
Value cards represent the purest form of value, such as the number 1 or the number 2. Their meaning is similar to what you would understand as mathematical 1 and 2 in everyday life, just expressed in the form of cards.          
## Operator cards
The concept of an Operator may not be common in your daily life, but you certainly know the symbol `+`. It is generally called the addition symbol. The operator cards we are referring to here are similar to technical symbols that you commonly encounter, such as `+` and `-`. As you may have noticed, operator cards represent symbols that can link two 'values' (corresponding to value cards in the game) together to form a new expression, such as `1+1`, `4-3`, and so on.
## Assertion cards
An Assertion card contains a statement describing a mathematical concept, such as "this is an even number" or "this is an odd number". We can obtain a value through an expression formed by Value cards and Operator cards, and then use our mathematical knowledge to determine the truth or falsehood of the assertion. For example, `1+1 | is odd` and `1+1 | is even`. We know that the first combination is false and the second combination is true.

The assertion card states that in addition to the assertion itself, there are two very important things on the card: victory points(VP) and failure points(FP). What are these values used for? They are used to determine which side wins or loses the game in the end. For each true combination, your final victory points will be increased by the victory points on that assertion card. Conversely, if it is false, points will be deducted. The person with the most victory points at the end wins, or it's a tie.
